Golang Assignment
Objective
Build a scalable RESTful Task Management Service in Go demonstrating API design,
persistence, concurrency, authentication, and clean architecture.
Problem Statement
Design and implement a Task Management REST API.
Core Requirements
REST APIs
Implement the following endpoints:
• POST /tasks – Create a task
• GET /tasks – List tasks
• GET /tasks/{id} – Get task by ID
• DELETE /tasks/{id} – Delete task
Task Model
{
 "id": "string / uuid",
 "title": "string",
 "description": "string",
 "status": "pending | in_progress | completed",
"created_at": "timestamp",
"updated_at": "timestamp"
}

Persistence
• Use SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB)
• Implement a clean repository/data access layer
Authentication & Authorization
• Implement authentication using JWT
• Add a simple User model (id, email/username, role)
• Protected APIs must require a valid JWT
• Implement authorization:
o Users can access only their own tasks
o Admin users can access all tasks
• Token expiry and proper error handling expected
Concurrency
Background Worker – Auto-Complete Tasks
Implement a background worker that automatically marks a task as completed after X
minutes if it is still in pending or in_progress.
Requirements:
• Auto-completion delay (X minutes) configurable via environment variable
• Tasks manually completed or deleted before X minutes must not be autocompleted
• Updated task state must be persisted to the database
Concurrency Expectations:
• Use goroutines for background processing
• Use channels / worker queue to send task IDs
• Ensure thread-safe access to shared resources
• Background processing must not block API requests

Error Handling & Validation
• Proper HTTP status codes
• Input validation
• Consistent JSON error responses
Code Quality & Design
• Idiomatic Go code
• Clear folder structure
• Separation of concerns (handlers, services, repositories)
• Configuration via environment variables
Bonus (Optional)
• Pagination & filtering
• Unit tests
• Dockerfile
• Swagger / OpenAPI
• Graceful shutdown using context.Context
• Logging & metrics
• Rate limiting or middleware
Submission Guidelines
• Push code to GitHub
• Include a README.md with implementation details
